# MyEngThesis - Security of coud based machine learning

Some work taken out of my engineering thesis. I can't show exactly how I'm trying to make cloud-based machine learning safer yet, but some of my basic work can be presented.Â 
  - During my work on this thesis I've created 3 image dataset, used my own Sequential models, mobileNetV2 and ResNet to compare results.
  - I used python, keras, tensorflow and scikit-image library.
  - Preparation of machine learning models was done first on google colab and next on paperspace-gradient.
